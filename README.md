# The-Odin-Project

## Introduction

The Odin Project is a free, open-source, self-paced, and full-stack web development curriculum that is designed to help individuals learn web development from scratch. It was created in 2013 by Erik Trautman and was named after the Norse god, Odin, who is associated with wisdom, knowledge, and learning.

## Goal

As I mentioned in the introduction the Odin project is a well-organized platform. I'm really interested in building all the projects within this platform with my own method.
